# barber-log

##Description
Barber Log is a full stack Web App that was developed in the front end with HTML CSS JavaScript VueJS. 
In the back end I used Node Express MongoDB and Heroku to deploy the web app. Barber log allows barbers
to log the services provided. Barbers are able to retrieve, create, edit, and delete a service. The Web App
also allows barbers to see their current earnings.
